ComiCoid - Android, Glide, Volley, Marvel API, Navigation bar style

I use MarvelAPI and develope an Android App to get the list of all Marvel Character, Comics, Events and Series.

<b>Glide Library</b><br>working with images, since it'll load images into the memory pixel by pixel. A single photo of an average phone camera with the dimensions of 2592x1936 pixels (5 megapixels) will allocate around 19 MB of memory. If you add the complexity of network requests on spotty wireless connections, caching and image manipulations, you will safe yourself a lot of time & headache, if you use a well-tested and developed library like Glide.

<b>Volley Library</b><br>Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available through the open AOSP repository.
Volley offers the following benefits:
Automatic scheduling of network requests. Multiple concurrent network connections. Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence. Support for request prioritization. Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel. Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff. Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network. Debugging and tracing tools.
